  * Updated to upstream 2.12.0 version; differences listed at
    http://openhpi.org/News
  * Few substantial changes except normal bug-fixing.  Most important

 -- Bryan Sutula <Bryan.Sutula@hp.com>  Thu, 31 Jul 2008 16:09:20 -0600

  * Newer upstream should work with gcc 4.3 (Closes: 474897)

    a cast problem in glib (to be investigated further)

 -- Bryan Sutula <Bryan.Sutula@hp.com>  Wed, 09 Apr 2008 16:07:45 -0600

    http://openhpi.org/News
  * Changed licensing terms of the Debian packaging to be BSD instead
    of GPL, to be consistent with the licensing of the rest of the package

    of the README files which are only installed in /usr/share/doc/libopenhpi2
  * Added "Recommends" of openhpid to libopenhpi2 as per bug discussion;
    (Closes: 415598)

openhpi (2.6.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor source change to fix build problem on sparc
  * Moved openhpi metapackage to extra (openhpi-plugin-sysfs is extra)

 -- Bryan Sutula <Bryan.Sutula@hp.com>  Mon, 22 Jan 2007 11:53:56 -0700

openhpi (2.6.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Missed adding the SAF copyright to debian/copyright; added
  * Version 2.6.2-1 was never distributed so this version also
    closes 2.6.2-1 bugs (Closes: 399794)

 -- Bryan Sutula <Bryan.Sutula@hp.com>  Tue, 09 Jan 2007 09:42:15 -0700

openhpi (2.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to upstream 2.6.2 version.  A major change for 2.6.2
    is that the openhpi daemon is now always required, eliminating
    the openhpi-switcher application.
  * Updated the SAF license as per SAF board of directors. The entire
    package is now DFSG-free and eligible to move from the non-free to
    the main repository.  See copyright and copyright.SAF
  * Moved openhpi-plugin-sysfs from optional to extra (depends on
    libsysfs2 which is extra) (Closes: 399794)

 -- Bryan Sutula <Bryan.Sutula@hp.com>  Wed, 27 Dec 2006 17:03:30 -0700

openhpi (2.5.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clean up and fix debian/copyright file
  * Remove docs/hld subdirectory (license may not be DFSG compliant)
  * Remove docs/hld from upstream tarball (so we don't ship the above)
  * Moved the set of packages from main to non-free because the SAF
    license is not DFSG-compliant
  * Moved openhpi-plugin-simulator and openhpi-plugin-watchdog into the
    base library (libopenhpi2) to reduce package count
  * Moved the /usr/lib/openhpi/*.so symlinks from libopenhpi-dev to
    libopenhpi2.  This is not typical packaging, but OpenHPI dynamically
    loads plugin modules and the load call (lt_dlopenext) is looking for
    these .so symlinks.
  * Renamed the SNMP plugin to ...snmp-bc to more properly reflect its
    use with BladeCenter hardware
  * Fixed some IPMI package descriptions which were misleading
  * Removed "-Wall" and "-Wcast-align" from configure.ac because they cause
    ia64 compiles to fail (removed earlier but not in prior changelog)
  * Added debian/TODO file to capture things that still need work

 -- Bryan Sutula <Bryan.Sutula@hp.com>  Wed, 15 Nov 2006 12:03:37 -0700

openhpi (2.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Break out plugin modules into separate Debian packages.  This is
    important for low-memory installations.  (Not so much code size
    but the dependencies that certain plugins bring with them.)
  * Rename libopenhpi package to libopenhpi2 as per policy
  * Don't include .la files.  If these are included, then other packages
    will compile specific version dependencies to this version, and we'll
    have a lot of package upgrade issues.  If we really want them, we can
    add them back to a future version.
  * Removed manual dependency on libncurses5 from openhpi-plugin-ipmi as
    this issue appears to have been fixed between Sarge and Etch.
  * Minor change to cpp/oSaHpiTypesEnums.hpp because of g++ version 3
    to version 4 conversion.
  * Fixed minor packaging issues in preparation for first Debian upload.
  * Initial release (Closes: #379864)

openhpi (2.5.2-0hpde2) hpde-2-0-11-x; urgency=low

openhpi (2.5.2-0hpde1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * This was a development vehicle and wasn't released anywhere
  * First complete OpenHPI package for Debian (but not tested, not uploaded)
  * Includes separate .debs for libraries, etc.
  * Daemon start/stop should now work on package install/remove
  * Fixed 2.5.2 upstream plugin bug where example programs crash at exit();
    upstream doesn't call oh_close_handlers() in 2.6.0, aiui.
  * Please note that this will NOT install cleanly on 2.5.2-0hpde0; please
    --purge that package first before installing this
